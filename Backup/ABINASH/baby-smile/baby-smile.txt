Use Case Of Modules:
===================
         

1. Microphone (Mic)

    * Continuous Monitoring:
        Monitors the baby’s sounds at all times.

    * Cry Detection:
        Detects when the baby is crying and sends feedback to the application.

    * Persistent Cry Alert:
        If crying continues, it alerts the parents via phone and generates a warning sound.
   
2.Speaker Features:

    * Direct Communication:
        Allows parents to speak directly to the baby through the phone and the Baby Smile module.

    * Alerts:
        Generates warning sounds to indicate to the parents that the baby needs attention.

    *Smoothing Sounds:
        Plays smoothing melodies and natural sounds to comfort the baby.
        

3.Oxygen Sensor Features:

    * Continuous Monitoring:
        Tracks oxygen levels, CO2 levels, and harmful gases in the environment.

    * Real-Time Feedback:
        Sends continuous updates to the application about the gas levels and environment status.

    * Alerts:
        Generates a warning sound and notifies the parents via phone if any issues are detected.

    * Application Status Update:
        Provides detailed information on CO2 and O2 levels, as well as any harmful gases detected.

4.Room Temperature Sensor

    * Continuous Monitoring:
        Continuously tracks the room temperature and updates the application.

    * Automatic Fan Control:
        Activates the fan automatically if the room temperature rises.

    * Temperature Limit Alert:
        If the temperature exceeds the maximum and Minimum limit despite the fan running, the sensor alerts the parents via phone and generates a warning sound.        
        
5.Weight Sensor

    * Continuous Monitoring:
        Tracks the baby’s weight continuously and updates the application.

    * Daily Weight Tracking:
        Records weight data daily to monitor the baby's health and generate a weight graph in the app.

    * Movement Detection:
        Detects if the baby is move or stationary.
        Alerts the parents via phone and generates an alarm if the baby is moving.  

6.Fan

    * Temperature Regulation:
        Helps maintain the baby’s body temperature.

    * Automatic Operation:
        Turns on automatically if the baby feels warm or sweaty.

    * Temperature-Driven Control:
        Stops automatically if the room temperature becomes too low. 
        
        
7.IoT (Bluetooth, WiFi, or GSM)

    * Data Transmission:
        Transmits data from the Baby Smile module to the application using one of the following modules: Bluetooth, WiFi, or GSM.

    * Module Selection:
        The module used (Bluetooth, WiFi, or GSM) depends on the specific requirements and availability.

    * IoT Concept:
        Implements the IoT concept to enable efficient and reliable data communication.
