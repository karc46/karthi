Detection mechanism:
            *Piezoelectric sensor type-
            *These sensors operate based on the piezoelectric effect, where certain materials generate an electrical charge in response to mechanical stress
Alarm Indication:
             *Time Interval: If no movement is detected for a specific duration, usually around 20 seconds, an alarm is triggered.
             *The alarm can be visual LED indicator
