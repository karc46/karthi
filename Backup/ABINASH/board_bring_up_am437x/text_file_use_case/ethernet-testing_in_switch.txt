1. Set Up the Environment
-------------------------

    Connect the Devices:

        Connect the board to the Ethernet switch using an Ethernet cable.
        Connect your PC or test system to the same switch.

    Power On the Switch:
        Ensure the Ethernet switch is powered on and functioning properly.
        
       
2. Configure Network Settings
----------------------------

    Assign IP Addresses:        
    
    PC configuration:
                    $ sudo ifconfig <interface> 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
  
    Board configuration (on the board terminal):
                   
                    $ ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.20 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

    Verify Network Configuration:

         On both systems, use:

                    $ ifconfig
                    Ensure the assigned IPs and interfaces are correctly displayed.
                 
3. Test Connectivity
--------------------
    Ping Test:

        From the PC:

        ping 192.168.1.20

        From the board:

        ping 192.168.1.10
        
        
4. Debug Issues (if any)
------------------------
    Check Cables: Ensure the cables are securely connected and functional.
      
    Firewall Rules: Disable any firewalls temporarily on the PC and board for testing purposes:

sudo ufw disable
